# SudokuSolver
In order to get some practice with Ruby, I created a simple Sudoku Solver. You can either solve the default puzzle or input your own puzzle. Example found in repo.

First, I wrote this the best I possibly could with my current Ruby knowledge. Got the logic down and the program worked great, however, there was a lot of code duplication and extraneous statements. I didn't know this after initially writing it though. 

Next, I took an advanced course in Ruby to learn about all the neat things you can do with it.

After spending a collective 10-15 hours on the course, I refactored my program and definitely cleaned it up. Pretty happy with it and would love any suggestions to make it better so I know for next time!
